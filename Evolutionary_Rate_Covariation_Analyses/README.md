# Evolutionary_Rate_Covariation_Analyses
This directory contains scripts and methods for performing evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analyses. ERC was used to test whether plastid-encoded ribosomal protein genes (CpRP) are more highly correlated with nuclear-encoded gene groups that have plastid interactions (NuCpRP) compared to nuclear-encoded gene sets without such interactions (NuCyRP and NuCpOT).
