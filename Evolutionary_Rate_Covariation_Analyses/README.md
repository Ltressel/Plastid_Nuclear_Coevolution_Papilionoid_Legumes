# Evolutionary_Rate_Covariation_Analyses
This directory contains scripts and methods for performing evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analyses. ERC was used to test whether plastid-encoded ribosomal protein genes (CpRP) are more highly correlated with nuclear-encoded gene groups that have plastid interactions (NuCpRP) compared to nuclear-encoded gene sets without such interactions (NuCyRP and NuCpOT).

### Contents
- ```run_blastp.sh```: Script for running a BLASTp search to identify plastid-targeted proteins.
- ```run_erc_analysis.R```: R script for performing the evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis using Spearman rank correlations and bootstrap resampling.
- ```visualize_erc_results.R```: R script for visualizing the bootstrapped correlations between CpRP and nuclear-encoded gene groups.
