# Maximum_Likelihood_Coevolution_Analyses
This directory contains scripts and methods for performing maximum likelihood coevolution analyses to investigate whether nonsynonymous substitutions in CpRP and NuCpRP genes tend to coincide along the same branches of the phylogenetic tree, and whether these substitutions occur sequentially more often than expected under a null hypothesis.

### Contents
- ```run_codeml_coevolution.sh``` Script to run PAML (CODEML) for ancestral codon reconstruction using the F3 Ã— 4 codon model.
