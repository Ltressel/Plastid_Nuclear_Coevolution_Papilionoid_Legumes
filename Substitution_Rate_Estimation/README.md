# Substitution_Rate_Estimation

This directory contains scripts and methods for estimating the nonsynonymous (*dN*) and synonymous (*dS*) substitution rates for genes in the study. The analyses were conducted using **PAML v4.7** and **HyPhy**, with likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) to compare substitution rates between branches.
